                <p>The assignment was to create a minimum 0:30 animation in After Effects and this animation was to be a title sequence for a show or movie of their choosing. Students could not use music or images that are used in the original media and instead had to find/create music and imagery by themselves. I chose the anime Shōjo Kageki: Revue Starlight. I created a character-focused title sequence that was light-hearted and cute which is similar to the original title sequence but doesn't go into the more dramatic moments of the anime.</p>

I chose the song Uranium Fever by Elton Britt &amp; Penny Britt. I leaned into the "old-timely" and happy tone of the song</p>

                    <p>The assignment was to create a 0:30 amination in After Effects using stock music and simple geometric shapes. I used a song called Coffee Morning by Olga Scotland. The image that I thought of while listing to this song was a stroll though a city in the early morning, so I used building shapes that would pop up to the beat of the song, a color palette similar to a sunrise, and a animated line that represented the flow of the melody of the song.</p>

                    <p>This web page was created at the beginning of my Interactive Design II course and using what they had learned from Interactive Design I and  a few assignments from Interactive Design II before the project was assigned, students were to create a one page web-page that represented themselves and held all their work form the course. I choose to do a high-contrast, energetic, and colorful design with a few animations added to the webpage.

                    <p>The assignment was to create a one page web-page for a restaurant, ‘Krazy Trompos’, in three view sizes: phone, tablet, and laptop. This web page wasto be designed based on the mood of the restaurant and contain the necessary information such as the menu, an about section, and catering form. I created a colorful and playful design to match with the light-hearted jokes sprinkled in the menu descriptions and the images on the original web page.

                    <p>This project was to create a printable poster for a location of the student's choosing and reference landmarks and capture the mood of the location. With a limited color palette and research I created a poster for Busan, South Korea, Busan is a night-city known for their beaches and nightlife.

                    <p>The assignment was to create a logo, business card, envelope, and letter head for either themselves or a preexisting company. I chose to base my designs formyself as a freelance designer. I created the logo to be an abstract representation of a few of my personal interest. For the color scheme I chose colors that paired well and that fit with the calmer more mysterious mood I was going for.

A duo-tone image of the typeface creator was also to be included in the type specimen as well.
