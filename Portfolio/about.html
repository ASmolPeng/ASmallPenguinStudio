        <p>Hi, my name is Hannah and I am a Graphic Design student. My first experience with design of any sort was in high school at the Landstown Govenor's STEM Academy where I took classes that were part of a Modeling and Simulation path in the academy. From those classes I learned different CAD software, animation principles, and 3D printing. I also earned two certifcations from these classes. These classes were my first introduction to basic design traits like color, texture, animation, staging, storyboarding, and sketching. Although, I didn't really start gaining a full understanding of design till taking classes at TCC. At TCC and the Visual Arts Center I was able to, and still am, learn more about the bits of design I knew the basics of and could build upon those foundations to create a proper comprehension of design. I've gained a wealth of knowledge about design within a digital medium ranging from Adobe software, web design, photography, illustration, and animation. From where I started to current day, I have vastly improved overtime and plan to continue to grow from here to the future.</p>
